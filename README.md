# NocoDB Python Client

NocoDB is a great Airtable alternative. This client allows python developers
to use NocoDB API in a simple way.

This is a fork of the pretty well written python library from [elchicodepython](https://github.com/elchicodepython/python-nocodb).

I offer no support for this library. Feel free to use it as it is. If it doesn't work for you, feel free to fork and fix it.

I'm in no way responsible for any kind of data loss caused by the use of this library. You should use it at your own risk.

If you want to pay someone a coffee, send it to [elchicodepython](https://ko-fi.com/elchicodepython) as he's the original maintainer.

I didn't submit a PR because I wrote a lot of code and I didn't want/have time to type everything / negociate with users/maintainers.

I'm pushing this upstream because I need to pull it from multiple sources, and maybe it can help anyone.
